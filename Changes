Revision history for Sub::Called

0.02    2008-07-22
        - bugfixes: 
            * when script do not use strict "with_ampersand" always returns 0
            * with_ampersand checked always first subroutine call for each line. 
              This is a bug as you can call more than one subroutine per line.
              Thanks to "betterworld"
